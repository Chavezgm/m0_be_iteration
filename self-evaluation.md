# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
The each methos is useful because when the code ask for a specific task .each helps and inspect each element in the array.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I believe that I still need really memorize the commands to where they are muscle memory.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
Working in irb and going over my code to check went very well because I was able to go back and problem solve incase I was stuck on something. I also really go the hang of this assignment while practcing it.
